# SortItUp
A Sorting Algorithm Visualizer web application

## Project Description

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help users understand how various sorting algorithms work. It provides a dynamic visualization of the sorting process, allowing users to see elements being compared and moved in real-time. Additionally, it displays the pseudocode for the selected algorithm, enhancing the learning experience.

## Features

* **Dynamic Bar Visualization:** Watch bars representing numbers rearrange as the sorting algorithm executes.

* **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Choose from a selection of popular sorting algorithms including:

    * Insertion Sort

    * Selection Sort

    * Bubble Sort

    * Quick Sort

    * Merge Sort

* **Adjustable Elements:** Customize the number of elements (bars) to be sorted, from 5 to 50.

* **Animation Speed Control:** Control the speed of the visualization (Fast, Medium, Slow) to better observe the steps.

* **Pseudocode Display:** View the high-level pseudocode for the currently selected sorting algorithm, providing insight into its logic.

* **Interactive Controls:** Start, pause (implicitly by not starting another sort), and reset the visualization with intuitive buttons.

* **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.

* **CSS3 (Tailwind CSS):** For styling and responsive layout.

* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For implementing the sorting algorithms, canvas drawing, and all interactive logic.

* **Font Awesome:** For icons (e.g., dark/light mode toggle, if implemented).

## How to Use

1.  **Open the `index.html` file:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2.  **Select an Algorithm:** Use the "Sort Algorithm Selector" dropdown to choose the sorting technique you want to visualize.

3.  **Adjust Elements (Optional):** Use the "Elements" input field to set the number of bars you want to sort (between 5 and 50).

4.  **Adjust Speed (Optional):** Use the "Speed" dropdown to set the animation speed (Fast, Medium, Slow).

5.  **Start Visualization:** Click the "Start Sorting" button to begin the visualization of the selected algorithm.

6.  **Reset Array:** Click the "Reset Array" button to generate a new random array with the current number of elements.

## Pseudocode Explanation

The pseudocode displayed for each algorithm provides a simplified, human-readable outline of the algorithm's steps. It uses common programming constructs and plain language to describe the logic without getting into the specific syntax of any programming language. This helps in understanding the fundamental operations performed by each sort.

## Future Updates

* **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Implement a feature to switch between dark and light themes for improved user experience and accessibility.

* **Additional Sorting Algorithms:** Expand the range of visualized algorithms to include more advanced or specialized sorting techniques.
